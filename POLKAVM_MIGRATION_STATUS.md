# PolkaVM Migration Status

## Current Status: In Progress

### ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - ✓ Installed @parity/hardhat-polkadot@0.1.5
   - ✓ Updated hardhat.config.js with PolkaVM configuration
   - ✓ Updated .gitignore for PolkaVM artifacts
   - ✓ Created separate artifacts-pvm directory

2. **Contract Compilation**
   - ✓ Contracts compile successfully for PolkaVM
   - ✓ MockV3Aggregator bytecode: 7,923 bytes (within 100KB limit)
   - ✓ Paramify bytecode: 38,934 bytes (within 100KB limit)

3. **Network Configuration**
   - ✓ Connected to Passet Hub testnet (Chain ID: 420420422)
   - ✓ Account balance: 4990.95 PAS
   - ✓ PolkaVM flag enabled for network
   - ✓ Network is operational (block 530007)

### ❌ Current Issue

**Problem**: "Invalid Transaction" error when attempting deployment
- Simple transfers fail with "Invalid Transaction"
- Contract deployments fail with same error
- Gas estimation returns unrealistic values (12717737240033)

### 🔍 Investigation Findings

1. The hardhat-polkadot plugin is correctly loaded
2. The network has `polkavm: true` setting
3. The provider is HardhatEthersProvider
4. Standard Ethereum transaction format is being rejected

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Research PolkaVM Transaction Format**
   - Check if PolkaVM requires special transaction encoding
   - Investigate if resolc compiler needs additional configuration
   - Review Polkadot documentation for PolkaVM-specific requirements

2. **Alternative Deployment Methods**
   - Try using Hardhat Ignition with PolkaVM support
   - Test with different gas settings
   - Explore PolkaVM-specific deployment scripts

3. **Fallback Options**
   - Consider using standard EVM deployment on Passet Hub
   - Investigate if PolkaVM support is fully operational on testnet

### 📊 Progress Tracker

- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Configure Hardhat
- [x] Compile contracts
- [x] Verify network connection
- [ ] Deploy MockV3Aggregator
- [ ] Deploy Paramify contract
- [ ] Update frontend integration
- [ ] Test contract functionality
- [ ] Document deployment process

### 🚨 Blockers

1. **Transaction Format**: PolkaVM appears to use a different transaction format than standard EVM
2. **Documentation**: Limited documentation on PolkaVM deployment specifics
3. **Network Support**: Unclear if Passet Hub fully supports PolkaVM deployment

### 📝 Notes

- The @parity/hardhat-polkadot plugin version 0.1.5 is relatively new
- Passet Hub may have specific requirements for PolkaVM deployment
- Consider reaching out to Polkadot community for guidance
