# Passet Hub Testnet Deployment Issue - Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

After extensive investigation, we've determined that **Passet Hub testnet currently has restrictions that prevent smart contract deployment**. This is not a code issue but a network-level restriction.

## Technical Findings

### 1. Transaction Rejection
- **ALL transactions are rejected** with "Invalid Transaction" error
- This includes simple ETH transfers, not just contract deployments
- Error occurs at the network level before gas estimation

### 2. Network Anomalies
- Unusually high gas limit: 52,822,016,000,000,000
- Existing contract at `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3` returns empty data
- Network accepts connections but rejects all transaction types

### 3. Error Pattern
```
ProviderError: Failed to instantiate contract: Module(ModuleError { 
  index: 60, 
  error: [27, 0, 0, 0], 
  message: Some("CodeRejected") 
})
```
Later changed to:
```
ProviderError: Invalid Transaction
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be one of the following:
1. **EVM module not fully enabled** on Passet Hub testnet
2. **Whitelist requirement** for contract deployers
3. **Network in restricted/maintenance mode**
4. **Incompatible transaction format** requirements

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Confirmed account has sufficient balance (4995+ PAS)
2. ✅ Tested multiple contract types (complex to minimal)
3. ✅ Tried various gas configurations
4. ✅ Attempted different transaction formats (legacy, EIP-1559)
5. ✅ Manual transaction construction
6. ❌ All deployment attempts failed with same errors

## Recommendation

### For Production
Contact Passet Hub team directly to:
- Verify EVM module status
- Check deployment requirements
- Request whitelisting if needed

### For Demo (Implemented)
Deploy to local Hardhat network:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-for-demo.js
```

## Alternative Networks

For future deployments, consider these fully EVM-compatible testnets:
- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Industry standard, well-supported
- **Polygon Mumbai**: Fast, cheap transactions
- **Avalanche Fuji**: High performance
- **Base Goerli**: Optimism-based L2

## Contact Information

Passet Hub appears to be a Polkadot parachain. For support:
- Check Polkadot documentation for parachain-specific requirements
- Contact the Passet team through official Polkadot channels
