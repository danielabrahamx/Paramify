# Paramify: Decentralized Flood Insurance Proof of Concept

![alt text](image.png)


## Overview

**Paramify** is a proof of concept (PoC) for a decentralized flood insurance platform built on Ethereum, demonstrating automated insurance purchases and payouts triggered by flood level data from a Chainlink-compatible oracle. This PoC showcases a smart contract (`Paramify.sol`) that allows users to buy flood insurance policies and claim payouts when flood levels exceed a predefined threshold, with role-based access control for secure administration.

Paramify highlights the potential for decentralized insurance applications. While currently implemented on Ethereum using Hardhat, the architecture is adaptable to Avalanche C-Chain or other EVM-compatible networks. This README provides instructions to set up, deploy, and demo the PoC locally, along with steps to test key features.

### Features
- **Insurance Purchase**: Users buy policies by paying a premium (10% of coverage), e.g., 0.1 ETH for 1 ETH coverage.
- **Automated Payouts**: Payouts are triggered when the flood level exceeds 3 feet, sending coverage (e.g., 1 ETH) to the policyholder.
- **Real-Time Flood Data**: Backend server fetches live USGS water level data every 5 minutes and updates the blockchain oracle.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admins manage the contract, oracle updaters set flood levels, and insurance admins configure parameters.
- **Frontend Interface**: A React-based UI allows users to connect wallets, buy insurance, view flood levels, and trigger payouts.
- **Backend API**: Node.js server provides real-time flood data integration with automatic oracle updates.



## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or 23.x (tested with 23.9.0).
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for wallet interactions.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Hardhat**: For contract deployment and testing.
- **Python 3** (optional): For alternative frontend serving if `http-server` is unavailable.


## Quick Start: Choose Your Environment

This project can be run in either **GitHub Codespaces** (cloud) or on your **local machine**. Follow the instructions for your preferred environment below.

---

## Quick Deployment Summary

For a complete local deployment, run these commands in order:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts and fund
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat run scripts/fund-contract.js --network localhost

# Terminal 3: Start backend server (real-time flood data)
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 4: Start frontend
cd frontend  
npm run dev
```

Then configure MetaMask with the Hardhat network and import test accounts. The system will show real-time flood level updates in the backend terminal every 5 minutes.

## A. GitHub Codespaces Deployment

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/paramify.git
cd paramify
npm install
npm install -g http-server
```

### 2. Start the Hardhat Node
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
- This starts a node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (Chain ID 31337) and prints test accounts and private keys.

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
- Note the deployed `Paramify` contract address. Update `frontend/index.html` with this address in `PARAMIFY_ADDRESS`.

### 4. Fund the Contract
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/fund-contract.js --network localhost
```
- This sends 2 ETH to the contract for payouts.

### 5. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
- This starts the backend server on port 3001 with real-time USGS flood data updates.
- The server fetches flood levels every 5 minutes and updates the blockchain oracle.
- You'll see live flood level updates in the terminal (e.g., "Latest water level: 4.11 ft").

### 6. Serve the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
http-server -p 8080
```
- If `http-server` is unavailable, use:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8080
  ```
- In the Codespaces "Ports" tab, make port 8080 public. Open the resulting URL (e.g., `https://<random-id>-8080.app.github.dev`) in your browser.

### 6. Configure MetaMask
- In the Codespaces "Ports" tab, make port 8545 public. Use the public URL (e.g., `https://<random-id>-8545.app.github.dev`) as the RPC URL in MetaMask.
- In MetaMask, add a new network:
  - Network Name: Hardhat (Codespace)
  - New RPC URL: (your public 8545 URL)
  - Chain ID: 31337
  - Currency Symbol: ETH
- Import test accounts using private keys from the Hardhat node output (see terminal logs).
- Update `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts` with the correct contract addresses if you redeploy contracts.

## B. Local Machine Deployment

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/paramify.git
cd paramify
npm install
npm install -g http-server
```

### 2. Start the Hardhat Node
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
- This starts a node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (Chain ID 31337) and prints test accounts and private keys.

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
- Note the deployed `Paramify` contract address. Update `frontend/index.html` with this address in `PARAMIFY_ADDRESS`.

### 4. Fund the Contract
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/fund-contract.js --network localhost
```
- This sends 2 ETH to the contract for payouts.

### 5. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
- This starts the backend server on port 3001 with real-time USGS flood data updates.
- The server fetches flood levels every 5 minutes and updates the blockchain oracle.
- You'll see live flood level updates in the terminal (e.g., "Latest water level: 4.11 ft").

### 6. Serve the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
- This starts the Vite development server on port 8080.
- Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### 6. Configure MetaMask
- In MetaMask, add a new network:
  - Network Name: Hardhat (Local)
  - New RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
  - Chain ID: 31337
  - Currency Symbol: ETH
- Import test accounts using private keys from the Hardhat node output (see terminal logs).
- Update `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts` and `backend/.env` with the correct contract addresses if you redeploy contracts.

---

**Note:** For both environments, always update the contract addresses in `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts` and `backend/.env` after redeployment. The backend server provides real-time flood data updates that you can monitor in the terminal output.

## Live Flood Data Monitoring

The Paramify system now includes real-time flood level monitoring:

- **Backend Terminal**: Shows timestamped flood level updates every 5 minutes (e.g., "Latest water level: 4.11 ft at 2025-06-25T04:45:00.000-04:00")
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Displays current flood levels in feet with automatic updates
- **API Endpoint**: Access flood data at `http://localhost:3001/api/flood-data`
- **Blockchain Oracle**: Automatically updated with scaled flood values for smart contract integration

## Demo Instructions

### 1. Buy Insurance
- Connect MetaMask as the customer (`0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199`).
- In the UI, enter `1` in “Coverage amount (ETH)” (premium: 0.1 ETH).
- Click “Buy Insurance” and confirm in MetaMask.
- Verify: Premium: 0.1 ETH, Coverage: 1 ETH, Status: Active.

### 2. Set Flood Level
- Connect as the deployer (`0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`).
- Enter `3001` in “New flood level” (threshold: 3000).
- Click “Update Flood Level” and confirm.
- Verify: Flood level is 3001.0 units.

### 3. Trigger Payout
- Connect as the customer.
- Click “Trigger Payout” and confirm.
- Verify:
  - Status: Paid Out.
  - Customer balance increases by 1 ETH (check “Your Balance” or MetaMask).
  - Contract balance decreases to ~1.1 ETH.

### 4. Edge Cases
- **Low Flood Level**: Set flood level to 2000 and try payout (fails: “Flood level below threshold”).
- **Low Contract Balance**: Deploy a new contract without funding and try payout (fails: “Payout failed”).
- **Duplicate Policy**: Try buying another policy while one is active (fails: “Policy already active”).

## Testing

Run unit tests to verify contract functionality:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
- Tests cover:
  - Policy creation and validation.
  - Payout triggering above/below threshold.
  - Role-based access control.
  - Contract funding and withdrawal.

To verify the current state:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-policy.js --network localhost
```
- Example script (`scripts/check-policy.js`):
  ```javascript
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

  async function main() {
    const customer = "0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199";
    const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("Paramify", "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512");
    const policy = await contract.policies(customer);
    console.log("Policy:", {
      active: policy.active,
      premium: ethers.formatEther(policy.premium),
      coverage: ethers.formatEther(policy.coverage),
      paidOut: policy.paidOut,
    });
    const balance = await contract.getContractBalance();
    console.log("Contract Balance:", ethers.formatEther(balance), "ETH");
    const customerBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(customer);
    console.log("Customer Balance:", ethers.formatEther(customerBalance), "ETH");
  }

  main().catch(console.error);
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend server not starting:**
  - Ensure Node.js is installed and run `npm install` in the backend directory.
  - Check if port 3001 is available: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` (Windows) or `lsof -i :3001` (Mac/Linux).
- **Frontend not loading:**
  - Ensure frontend is running on port 8080: `npm run dev` in the frontend directory.
  - Check if port 8080 is available and kill conflicting processes if needed.
- **No flood data updates:**
  - Check the backend terminal for error messages.
  - Verify the backend server is connected to the blockchain (should show "Connected to: 0xf39...").
- **Contract address mismatch:**
  - Update both `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts` and `backend/.env` with the new contract addresses after redeployment.
- **MetaMask Issues:**
  - Ensure Hardhat network is added and accounts are imported.
  - Verify you're connected to the correct network (Chain ID 31337).
