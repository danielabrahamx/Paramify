# Paramify Codebase Export for LLM Analysis

## Project Overview
Paramify is a blockchain-based flood insurance protocol that uses real-time USGS water level data to automatically trigger insurance payouts when flood thresholds are exceeded. The system consists of smart contracts (Solidity), a backend service (Node.js), and frontend dashboards (React/TypeScript) with NFT-based policy management.

## Architecture Summary
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts for insurance logic and NFT policy management
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server for USGS API integration and blockchain interaction
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript dashboards for customers and admins
- **NFT System**: ERC-721 soulbound tokens representing insurance policies

## Key Features & Implementation Notes

### NFT Policy System
- Each insurance policy is minted as an ERC-721 NFT
- NFTs are soulbound (non-transferable after minting)
- Policy details stored on-chain in NFT metadata
- Real-time metadata updates when policy status changes
- SVG-based visual representation of policy status

### Data Flow
1. USGS API provides real-time water level data in feet
2. Backend converts feet to contract units (Ã—100,000,000,000) and updates oracle
3. Smart contract stores and compares values in contract units
4. Frontend converts back to feet for user-friendly display

### Security Features
- Only contract owner can update flood threshold
- Admin wallet verification in frontend
- Input validation for all numeric inputs
- Comprehensive error handling and timeout management

### Testing & Deployment
- 4-terminal workflow: Hardhat node, contract deployment, backend, frontend
- Contract addresses must be updated after every deployment
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues
